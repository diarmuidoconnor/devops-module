##  Extend the CI pipeline.

We want to add a job to the pipeline's test stage. The job should check the basic working state of the profileapp image, such that when a container running the image receives an HTTP request on port 3000, its response should include the web app's home page. A successful response will also mean the app connects to the Mongo database, as this is part of its start-up procedure. In `.gitlab-ci.yml`, replace the base-test job with the following:
~~~yaml
base-test:
  stage: test
  image: docker:27.0.2-cli-alpine3.20
  services: 
     - docker:27.0.2-dind-alpine3.20
  before_script:
    - docker login -u ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME} -p ${DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN}
    - docker pull  ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}:${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}  
    - docker pull  mongo:8.0-rc 
    - docker network create mongo-network
  script: 
    - docker run -d --net mongo-network --name mongoDB -p 27017:27017 -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret  mongo:8.0-rc 
    - docker run -d --network mongo-network --name profileapp -p 3000:3000 -e MONGO_PASS=secret -e MONGO_HOST=mongoDB ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}:${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}
    - docker ps     # For debugging purposes
    - docker logs profileapp     # For debugging purposes
    - apk add curl
    - curl http://docker:3000 | grep 'User profile'
~~~
We are using the before-script block in the above job for code clarity only (separation of concerns); it would still work if all the commands were placed in the script block. The job's base image (docker:27.0.2-cli-alpine3.20) does not include the curl utility and must be installed by the script.


The curl command in the script cannot refer to the localhost domain name as it is not defined inside a container. Instead, a domain name derived from the base image's name (docker in this case) is used. We are using the grep Linux utility to look for a string or pattern in the response from the curl HTTP request. 

Trigger the execution of the pipeline as follows:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "CI pipeline job to perform a basic test of app."
$ git push origin main
~~~
In the Gitlab browser tab, check the pipeline runs successfully. Examine the log of the basic-test job as follows:

+ Click the tick mark of the test stage of the current pipeline execution.
+ Selecting basic-test job.
+ Scroll down to the end of the log. It should  look as follows:

~~~
$ docker logs profileapp
mongodb://admin:secret@mongoDB:27017
Server script
Server running at 3000
$ curl http://docker:3000 | grep 'User profile'
