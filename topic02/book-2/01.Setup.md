## Setup.

For the sake of variety, we will use a different application as the context for this lab. Create a folder (anywhere), and from there, clone a repository as follows:
~~~bash
$ git clone
~~~
The repository contains a web-based implementation of the [2048 Number Puzzle Game][game]. Import the project into VS Code and type the following commands:
~~~bash
$  docker build -t  2048game:1.0  .
$ docker run -d -p 3000:80 --name 2048game   2048game:1.0
~~~
Notice in the project's Dockerfile that the image of this app is based on the NGINX web server, and all the project's files are copied to the web server's base directory (/usr/share/nginx/html) 
 
In a browser tab, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to play the game.

Push this image to your Docker Hub account as follows:
~~~bash
$ docker login 
$ docker tag  2048game:1.0  myhubusername/2048game:1.0
$ docker push  myhubusername/2048game:1.0
~~~
[Replace myhubusername with your Hub username.]
