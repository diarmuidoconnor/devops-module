## Setup.

For the sake of variety, we will use a different application as the context for this lab. Create a folder (anywhere), and from there, clone a repository as follows:
~~~bash
$ git clone
~~~
The repository contains a web-based implementation of the [2048 Number Puzzle Game][game]. Import the project into VS Code and type the following commands:
~~~bash
$  docker build -t  2048game:1.0  .
$ docker run -d -p 3000:80 --name 2048game   2048game:1.0
~~~
Notice in the project's Dockerfile that the image of this app is based on the NGINX web server, and all the project's files are copied to the web server's base directory (/usr/share/nginx/html) 
 
In a browser tab, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to play the game.

### Docker Hub repository.

Push this image to your Docker Hub account as follows:
~~~bash
$ docker login 
$ docker tag  2048game:1.0  myhubusername/2048game:1.0
$ docker push  myhubusername/2048game:1.0
~~~
[Replace myhubusername with your Hub username.]

### Gitlab repository.

In a browser tab, log in to your Gitlab account. Using the left hand sidebar on Gitlab, follow these steps:

+ Click the plus (+) symbol, and select New Project/Repository. 
+ Select Create blank project.
+ Name the project 'docker-2048-game-app' (use this exact name).
+ Set the Visibility mode to Public.
+ Untick both Project Configuration options.
+ Click the Create Project button.

In VS Code, import the User Profile web app. Open an integrated terminal and type the commands:
~~~bash
$ git remote remove origin
$ git remote add origin [the URL of the new Gitlab repository]
e.g. git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/oconnordiarmuid/docker-2048-game-app
$ git branch main
$ git checkout main
$ git push origin main
~~~

Refresh the repository page on the browser.
