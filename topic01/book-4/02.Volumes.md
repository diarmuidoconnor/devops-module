## Docker Volumes.

A significant deficiency in our database-backed applications so far is that all data is lost when we recreate the container that runs the server. Try the following sequence:

1. Start the Profile web app using Docker Compose.
1. Edit the user profile via the web app at http://localhost:3000/
1. Delete the app's stack using Docker Compose.
1. (Re)Start the Profile web app using Docker Compose.
1. Reload the web app at http://localhost:3000/. __ The profile data changes you made are lost__.

To fix this problem, we must bind a directory on the host computer's filesystem to Mongo's database folder inside the container. In `compose.yaml`, add a configuration setting to the mongodb service as follows:
~~~yaml
mongodb:
    container_name: mongoDB
    image: mongo:8.0-rc
    . . . . . as before . . . .
    networks:
         - profile-network
    volumes:    # NEW
          - /absolute/path/to/project/data:/data/db  
~~~
The absolute path part of the volume must correspond to your host's pathname for this project, e.g. /Users/diarmuidoconnor/devops/profile-app/.  The effect of the volume setting is to add a folder called 'data' to your project. At container runtime, Docker binds the data folder on the host to the /db/data folder inside the container. Mongo's default database folder is /db/data.

Repeat the sequence performed earlier, but this time, the data persists between restarts of the app stack.
