## Multi-Container applications.

In this lab, we will assemble multi-container applications. The components (containers) communicate over a network managed by the Docker platform. A component uses a container's name when interacting with it over HTTP. We will manually set up the architecture, but a later lab will illustrate how to automate the task. Two sample application will be used as case studies, but their architecture is similar:

+ A Node/Express frontend app.
+ A database server.
+ A web-based database administration tool.
