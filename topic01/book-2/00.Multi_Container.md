## Multi-Container applications.

In this lab, we will assemble a multi-container application. The components (containers) communicate over a network managed by the Docker platform. We will manually set up the architecture, but a later lab will illustrate how to automate the task. The sample application is comprised of three components:

+ A (simple) server-side rendering web application.
+ A MongoDB database.
+ A web-based MongoDB administration tool.
