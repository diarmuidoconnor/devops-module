## Docker basics.

Start the Docker Desktop application. The application's GUI client should indicate no containers are currently running.

In VS Code, open an integrated terminal tab (alternatively, open a standard OS terminal window) and type the command:
~~~bash
$ docker ps
~~~
This command also shows no containers are currently running. Let's download an image, the Redis caching and NoSQL database application:
~~~bash
$ docker pull redis:7.2.5 
~~~
Confirm the download using the following command:
~~~bash
$ docker images.        (List all images)
~~~
Start a container to run this image:
~~~bash
$  docker run -d --name my-redis  redis:7.2.5 
~~~
+ -d - detached mode
+ --name - the custom name for the container instance (my-redis).
List all running containers:
~~~bash
$ docker ps
~~~
The response should look similar to the following:
~~~bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS      NAMES
2448b26dc40f   redis:7.2.5   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   3 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes   6379/tcp   my-redis
~~~
Check the logs generated inside the container:
~~~bash
$ docker logs my-redis
~~~
The logs are useful when debugging problems with container startup.
We can stop a container with the command:
~~~bash
$ docker stop my-redis
~~~
 Use the logs command to check how the container reacted to this instruction. Restart the same container:
~~~bash
$ docker start my-redis
~~~
We can have multiple instances of the same application running in parallel - the containers are completely isolated. Type the following command:
~~~bash
$  docker run -d --name my-second-redis  redis:7.2.5 
~~~
Confirm both containers are running:
~~~bash
$ docker ps
~~~
Now type the following commands:
~~~bash
$ docker stop my-redis
$ docker ps.      (Only running containers are listed)
$ docker ps -a       (All containers are listed)
$ docker start my-redis
$ docker ps.      (Both containers are now running)
~~~
To completely remove a container, use the commands:
~~~bash
$ docker stop my-redis.    (It's better to stop a container before removing it)
$ docker rm my-redis
$ docker ps -a
~~~
