## Setup - Part 1.

From the command line, type the following command:
~~~bash
$ docker pull mongo:8.0-rc.       (An image containing the MongoDB database server)
$ docker pull mongo-express:1.0-20-alpine3.19.       (An image containing a web-based MongoDB admin application)
$ docker create network mongo-network
~~~
 The last command creates a private network inside the Docker runtime environment. The network's name is arbitrary. To confirm the creation, type the command:
~~bash
$ docker network ls
~~~
The list will also include some default networks. 

Start a container for the MongoDB image:
~~~bash
$ docker run -d --net mongo-network \ 
    --name mongoDB  \
     -p 27017:27017 \
     -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin \ 
 -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret \ mongo
~~~
Points to note:
1. We can control the initialization of the image in a container via container environment variables using the -e option, as illustrated above. The variables required are specified in the image's documentation on Docker Hub. For example, go to [this page][mongov] and scroll to the Environment Variables section for details on the MongoD B image. Some image variables are optional and have default values.
1. We are linking our MongoDB container to the private network we created. Any other container that wants to communicate with this database must use the same network.
1. Port 27017 is the default MongoDB port.

Type the following command:
~~~bash
 $ docker run -d --network mongo-network \ 
      --name mongo-express  \
      -p 8081:8081 \
     -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin \
 -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=secret   \
    -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb   \
mongo-express:1.0-20-alpine3.19
~~~
Points to note:

1. The ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER above must be set to the __name of the container__ hosting our database, i.e. mongoDB
1. The ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME and ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD must match the credentials used by the MongoDB container. 
1. We are using the same private Docker network for both containers.
To access the MongoDB admin web application hosted by the second container, navigate to http://localhost:8081/ in a web browser. The page lists the databases managed by the MongoDB server running inside the first container. 

We want to add a new database to the server using the web admin tool. In the text box at the top-right, enter the name `user-account` and click the Create Database button. 

## Setup - Part 2.

Clone this repository:
~~~bash

~~~
The application is a simple server-side rendering web app for updating the user-account database managed by our MongoDB server.  Import the project into VS Code, open an integrated terminal and type the commands:
~~~bash
$ npm  install
$ cd app
$ node server.js
~~~
Open a new web browser tab at http://localhost:3000/. Click the Edit Profile button. In the web form, change the person's name, email address, and interests, then click the Update Profile button. This sequence should result in the web app __writing a record to a table named users in our user-account database__. We can use the Mongo Express application to confirm this. Switch to the browser tab that shows the Mongo Express application, click the View button beside the `user-account` database, and click the View button beside the `users` collection name. The page shows the details of the user profile you entered on the web form. Therefore, there are two lines of communication working in this setup:
Web app to MongoDB container - This is over the regular localhost network managed by the host computer's operating system.
Mongo Express container to MongoDB container - This is via the private, Docker-managed network we created - mongo-network.
