## Setup - Part 2.

Clone this repository:
~~~bash

~~~
The application is a simple server-side rendering web app for updating the user-account database managed by our MongoDB server.  Import the project into VS Code, open an integrated terminal and type the commands:
~~~bash
$ npm  install
$ cd app
$ node server.js
~~~
Open a new web browser tab at http://localhost:3000/. Click the Edit Profile button. In the web form, change the person's name, email address, and interests, then click the Update Profile button. This sequence should result in the web app __writing a record to a table named users in our user-account database__. We can use the Mongo Express application to confirm this. Switch to the browser tab that shows the Mongo Express application, click the View button beside the `user-account` database, and click the View button beside the `users` collection name. The page shows the details of the user profile you entered on the web form. Therefore, there are two lines of communication working in this setup:

1. Web app to MongoDB container - This is over the regular localhost network managed by the host computer's operating system.
1. Mongo Express container to MongoDB container - This is via the private, Docker-managed network we created - mongo-network.
