## Docker Registry.

We can push images to a registry to facilitate the sharing of images and have a backup copy in case of local host corruption. Many options are available, including Docker Hub (default), AWS ECR, GitLab, GitHub, etc. We will demonstrate DockerHub here. In a browser tab, go to https://hub.docker.com/ and sign in to your account. We will return to this page shortly.

Type the following commands:
~~~bash
$ docker login   (Login to Docker Hub)
$ docker tag dice:1.0 [DockerHubUsername]/dice:1.0
   e.g. docker tag dice:1.0 doconnor/dice:1.0
$ docker images
   . . . . . . .
   doconnor/dice    1.0                 3e561f20f452   21 hours ago   1.02GB
   dice             1.0                 3e561f20f452   21 hours ago   1.02GB
   . . . . . . . . 
$ docker push [DockerHubUsername]/dice:1.0
~~~
Return to the browser tab and refresh the page. You should now see a repository for the dice image.  On the command line, type:
~~~bash 
$ docker rmi doconnor/dice:1.0.   (Remove an image locally)
$ docker images
$ docker pull  doconnor/dice:1.0.    (Download an image from Docker Hub)
   [Note: anyone can download your image as it is public.]
$ docker images
~~~

Import the Dice game into VS Code. Open the file `script.py` and change line 10 to the following:
~~~py
 username = input('\nEnter your player name: ' ) 
~~~
Save the change and type the commands:
~~~bash
$  docker build -t doconnor/dice:1.1     (Note the updated tag number)
$ docker images
$ docker push  doconnor/dice:1.1    
~~~
In Docker Hub, the repository now has two versions of the image.
