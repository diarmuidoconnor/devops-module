## Demo App 2

## Demo 1 

Import into VS Code, the Web API app based on the Node and Express platform, and is integrated with a Postgres database - The Employee Management application. In the base folder of the app, create a file called `Dockerfile` and add the following set of instructions:
~~~txt
FROM node:20-alpine

ENV PORT=5000 \
    DB_USER='postgres' \
    DB_HOST='' \
    DB_NAME='postgres' \
    DB_PASSWORD='' \
    DB_PORT=5432

EXPOSE 5000

RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY . .
RUN npm install

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
~~~
From the project base folder, run the commands:
~~~bash
$ docker build -t employee-app:1.0 .
~~~

Start all the containers that make up this application:
~~~bash
$. docker rm -vf $(docker ps)     (It;s not always necessary to do this.)
$  docker run -d  --name postgresDB  \ 
    --network mongo-network  \
    -p 5432:5432 \
     -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass1234  \
     -e POSTGRES_DB=postgres   \
     postgres:13
$   docker run -d --name pgadmin4  \ 
    --network mongo-express  '
    -p 5050:80  ]
    -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin@email.com \
   -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=pass5678  \ 
dpage/pgadmin4:8.7
$ docker run -d --name employee  --network mongo-network  -e DB_HOST=postgresDB  -e DB_PASSWORD=pass1234   -p 3000:5000  employeeapp:1.0
~~~
Points to note:

1. The containers are linked to the same Docker-managed network. We reused the mongo-network custom network created in an earlier lab for convenience, although it needs to be better named for this demo.
1. For the Web API container (employee), we set the DB_HOST variable value to correspond to the name of the Postgres database  Thiscontainer. The Web API refers to the database server by its container name since they are both on the same network.
 
As you recall from the earlier lab on this application, you must first initialize the Postgres database using the PGAdmin tool running at http://localhost:5050. Refer to that lab for instructions on adding the required tables to the database. Once this initialization is completed, you can open a browser tab at http://localhost:3000/api-docs/ and play with the web API as before.
