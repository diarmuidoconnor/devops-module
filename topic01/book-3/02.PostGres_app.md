## Demo App 2

## Demo 1 

Import into VS Code, the Employee Management API project - recall, it was based on the Node and Express platform, and is integrated with a Postgres database. In the base folder of the app, create a file called `Dockerfile` and add the following set of instructions:
~~~txt
FROM node:20-alpine

ENV PORT=5000 \
    DB_USER='postgres' \
    DB_HOST='' \
    DB_NAME='postgres' \
    DB_PASSWORD='' \
    DB_PORT=5432

EXPOSE 5000

RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY . .
RUN npm install

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
~~~
Use the above file to build a Docker image of the app:
~~~bash
$ docker build -t employee-app:1.0 .
~~~

Start all the containers that make up this application's architecture:
~~~bash
$ docker rm -vf $(docker ps -aq)      (Clean up - Optiona.)
$ docker run -d  --name postgresDB  \ 
    --network mongo-network  \
    -p 5432:5432 \
     -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass1234  \
     -e POSTGRES_DB=postgres   \
     postgres:13

$ docker run -d --name pgadmin4  \ 
    --network mongo-express \
    -p 5050:80  ]
    -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin@email.com \
   -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=pass5678  \ 
   dpage/pgadmin4:8.7

$ docker run -d --name employee --network mongo-network \
   -e DB_HOST=postgresDB \
   -e DB_PASSWORD=pass1234 \
   -p 3000:5000 \
   employeeapp:1.0
~~~
Some points to note from above:

1. The containers are linked to the same Docker-managed network. For convenience, we reused the custom network created in an earlier lab (mongo-network).
1. Because they are on the same network, the Web API can communicate with the database server using the latter's container name as a domain or host name. This connection is made by setting the DB_HOST environment variable of the API container to the container name of the Postgres database container. 
 
In the earlier lab, where we introduced the Employee Management API, you will find instructions on initialising the Postgres database using the PGAdmin tool running at http://localhost:5050. Please refer back to that lab to complete the app's setup. Once this initialization is completed, you can open a browser tab at http://localhost:3000/api-docs/ and play with the web API as before.
