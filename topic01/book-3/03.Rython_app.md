## Run Anywhere.

To date, all our sample applications are based on the Node/JS platform, which, coincidentally, we have installed on our host computer. However, a benefit of Docker is the platform used by an application is not required on the host. To prove this, suppose we want to run a Python application without installing the language's CLI tools locally. Clone this repository:
~~~bash
git clone 
~~~
It's a Python console-based application for playing a simple dice-rolling game. Import it into VS Code and type the commands:
~~~bash
$  docker build -t dice:1.0 .
$ docker run  -it --name dice dice:1.0
~~~ 
You can now play a game written in Python on your host computer.
