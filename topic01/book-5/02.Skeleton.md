## Create the Pipeline.

### Skeleton CI pipeline.
In VS Code, add a new file called `.gitlab-ci.yml` to the project's base folder. Copy in the following code:
~~~yaml
variables:
 
  APP_NAME: 'profileapp'
  DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME: 'doconnor'. # Change to your Docker Hub username

stages:
 - build
 - test

build-and-publish:
  image: docker:20.10.16
  stage: build
  script:
 - echo "Build stage executed"
 - docker --version

test-with-curl:
  stage: test
  image: docker:20.10.16
  before_script:
 - echo 'Execute before main script'
  script: 
 - echo 'Reference a variable - '  ${APP_NAME}
~~~
[Note: You must set the DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME variable to your Docker Hub account username.]

The above pipeline consists of two stages, each with one job. Both jobs use the same Docker image - a Linux image with the Docker command line tool installed on top - see [here][dockeri. The scripts executed inside the jobs simply echo some strings to the container's command line. In VS Code, type the following commands:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Skeleton CI pipeline.
$ git push origin main
~~~
In the browser tab displaying your Gitlab repository, expand the left sidebar (move the mouse to the extreme left of the page) and select Build -> Pipelines. After the pipeline has completed executing,  click the tick mark for the build stage and click the build-and-publish job. Gitlab displays the terminal output generated inside the Docker CLI container that executed the job.

### Build Image Job.

In `.gitlab-ci.yml`, replace the build-and-publish job with the following:
~~~yaml
build-with-dind:
  image: docker:27.0.2-cli-alpine3.20
  services:
    - docker:27.0.2-dind-alpine3.20
  stage: build
  script:
     - echo "Build stage executed"
     - docker build -t ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}:${DOCKER_TAG} .
     - docker login -u ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME} -p ${DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN}
     - docker push  ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}:${DOCKER_TAG} 
~~~
