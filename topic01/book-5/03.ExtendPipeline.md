##  Extend the CI pipeline.

We want to add a job to the pipeline that tests whether the profileapp image works as expected. When a container running the image receives an HTTP request on port 3000, its response should include the web app's home page. A successful response will also mean the app connects to the Mongo database, as this is part of its start-up procedure. In `.gitlab-ci.yml`, replace the base-test job with the following:
~~~yaml
base-test:
  stage: test
  image: docker:27.0.2-cli-alpine3.20
  services: 
     - docker:27.0.2-dind-alpine3.20
  before_script:
     - docker login -u ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME} -p ${DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN}
     - docker pull  ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}:${DOCKER_TAG}  
     - docker pull  mongo:8.0-rc 
     - docker network create mongo-network
     - apk add curl
  script: 
     - docker run -d --net mongo-network --name mongoDB -p 27017:27017 -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret  mongo:8.0-rc 
     - docker run -d --network mongo-network --name profileapp -p 3000:3000 -e MONGO_PASS=secret  -e MONGO_HOST=mongoDB ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}:${DOCKER_TAG}
     - docker ps.    # For debugging purposes
     - curl http://docker:3000 | grep 'User profile'
~~~
We are using the before-script block in the above job for code clarity only (separation of concerns); it would still work if all the commands were placed in the script block. The curl command cannot use localhost as this domain is not defined in this context. Instead, the encapsulating container (docker:27.0.2-cli-alpine3.20)
 defines a domain derived from the image it is running (docker).

We are using the grep Linux utility to look for a string or pattern in the response from the HTTP request. Trigger the execution of the pipeline as follows:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "CI pipeline job to perform a basic test of app."
$ git push origin main
~~~
In the Gitlab browser tab, check the pipeline runs successfully. Examine the log of the basic-test job by clicking the test stage tick mark of the current pipeline execution and selecting basic-test job.
