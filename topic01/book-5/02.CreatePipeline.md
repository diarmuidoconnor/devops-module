## Create CI Pipeline.

### Skeleton CI pipeline.
In VS Code, add a new file called `.gitlab-ci.yml` to the project's base folder. Copy in the following code:
~~~yaml
variables:
   APP_NAME: 'profileapp'
   DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME: 'doconnor'. # Change to your Docker Hub username

stages:
   - build
   - test

build-and-publish:
  image: docker:20.10.16
  stage: build
  script:
     - echo "Build stage executed"
     - docker --version

base-test:
  stage: test
  image: docker:20.10.16
  before_script:
     - echo 'Execute before main script'
  script: 
     - echo 'Reference a variable - '  ${APP_NAME}
~~~
[Note: You must set the DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME variable to your Docker Hub account username.]

The above file declares a pipeline consisting of two stages, each with one job. Both jobs use the same Docker image - a Linux image with the Docker command line tool installed on top - see [here][dockeri. The scripts executed inside the jobs are basic; they echo some strings to the container's command line. In VS Code, type the following commands:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Skeleton CI pipeline."
$ git push origin main
~~~
GitLab will detect the presence of the YAML file and trigger a pipeline execution. In the browser tab displaying your Gitlab repository, expand the left sidebar (move the mouse to the extreme left of the page) and select Build -> Pipelines. After the pipeline has completed executing,  click the tick mark for the build stage and click the build-and-publish job. Gitlab displays the terminal output generated inside the Docker CLI container that executed the job.

### Build Image Job.

In `.gitlab-ci.yml`, replace the build-and-publish job with the following:
~~~yaml
build-and-publish::
  image: docker:27.0.2-cli-alpine3.20
  services:
    - docker:27.0.2-dind-alpine3.20
  stage: build
  script:
     - echo "Build stage executed"
     - docker build -t ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME} .
     - docker login -u ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME} -p ${DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN}
     - docker tag  ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}  ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}:${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA} 
    - docker push ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME}/${APP_NAME}:${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}
~~~
The intent of this job is to build a fresh image of the user profile web app. The image's name is prefixed with your Docker Hub username and tagged with the SHA1 hash (short form) of the most recent Git commit, e.g.
>> doconnor/profileapp:715bae7f 
Before attempting a ' docker push ' command, the pipeline job must log in to your Docker Hub account. 
> docker login -u ${DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME} -p ${DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN}
The login requires a token to authenticate the login request. 

--------------------------
#### Docker Hub Token.
Open a browser tab at Docker Hub and log in to your account. Then, click the avatar on the top right, select Account Settings, select Security (left sidebar), and click the New Access Token button. Type GitLab CICD as the description and click Generate Token. Copy the token value into the clipboard for later use.

--------------------------
A token is sensitive data and should not be included directly in the GitLab YAML file. We declare it as an environment variable instead. In the GitLab browser page, open the sidebar on the left and select Settings -> CI/CD. Scroll down and click the Variables heading. Click the 'Add Variable' button on the right and fill out the form as follows:

+ Set Type to Variable.
+ Set Environment to All
+ Set Visibility to Visible. 
+ All Flags should be unticked.
+ Set Key to DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN
+ Set Value to the generated token value you copied into the clipboard.

Click the Save Changes button and close the form. 
 
-----------------------------
#### GitLab Services.

" When you configure CI/CD, you specify an image, which is used to create the container where your jobs run. To specify this image, you use the image keyword.
You can specify an additional image by using the services keyword. This additional image is used to create another container, which is available to the first container. The two containers have access to one another and can communicate when running the job." GitLab Documentation

Our build job uses the Services option to run a container with the Docker In Docker image. This image contains the Docker Deamon (Docker Runtim or Docker Server) used to perform docker build operations, for example. 
~~~yaml
some-job:
  image: docker:27.0.2-cli-alpine3.20
  services:
     - docker:27.0.2-dind-alpine3.20.  <-----|
  stage: build                               |
  script:                                    |
     - docker build -t ______ .      <-------|    
~~~

-------------------------------

Returning to VS Code, we can now push our CI pipeline changes to the GitLab repository and trigger a pipeline execution as follows:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Added  Image build and publish job to CI pipeline."
$ git push origin main
~~~
In the GitLab browser tab, open the sidebar on the left and select Build -> Pipelines. Wait for the current pipeline execution to complete, and then switch to the browser tab with Docker Hub. Select the Repositories tab in the page header and notice a new entry for your 'profileapp' image.
