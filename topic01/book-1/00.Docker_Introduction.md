# Introducton to Docker.

In this lab, we will practice the basic operations when using the Docker platform for running applications. These include:

+ Downloading app images from Docker Hub.
+ Starting a container to run an app image.
+ Opening an interactive terminal to see inside a container.
+ Stopping/Restarting containers.
+ etc 

## Prerequisites.
This lab assumes you have already installed the Docker Desktop application (see ]here][dddocs] for installation details) and created an account on Docker Hub (see [here][dhub] ).
