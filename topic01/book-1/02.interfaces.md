## Interacting with a Container.

We could not interact with the above containers because we are unfamiliar with the Redis application. A more straightforward image to understand would be NGINX, a web server for static websites. Type the following commands:
~~~bash
 $ docker pull nginx:1.15.8-alpine     (The version/tag used (1.15.8-alpine) is arbitrary)
$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name nginx-server  nginx:1.15.8-alpine
~~~
+ -p option - Inside the container, the NGINX web server listens on the default port, 80. We must map that port to a host machine port - we choose 8080 arbitrarily. 

In a web browser, navigate to http://localhost:8080/. You should see the default NGINX home page. We can change this page by going inside the container. Open a shell session inside the container as follows:
~~~bash
$ docker exec -it  nginx-server  /bin/sh
~~~
The response shows a command prompt from __inside the container__. You can type any Linux command at this prompt. Type the following command sequence:
~~~bash
/ # ls
/ # env
/ # pwd
/ # cd /usr/share/nginx/html.   (NGINX default home directory)
/ # ls
/ # cat index.html     (The NGINX default home page)
/ # echo "<b>I added a new line ....</b>" >> index.html 
~~~
The last command above adds a new line to the NGINX home page. Refresh the page in the browser to confirm the presence of the new line. This is a very inefficient way to update the website hosted by NGINX. We will use a better approach later in the module. 

Type exit to terminate the container shell and return to the host prompt.
